# Machine Learning Portfolio
This is a school assignment for the Embedded Vision and Machine Learning minor that I did at the HAN in Arnhem in 2020-2021.

It uses SIFT features, k-means and k-nearest-neighbour to do image classification on a small dataset. It uses some preprocessing, and the pictures in the dataset are taken in a controlled environment.
